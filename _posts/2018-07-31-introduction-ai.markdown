# **Artificial Intelligence**

####                    **"To make computers easily do all that which comes easy to humans".**

AI (Artificial Intelligence) has been something that has slowly been developing in the past few years, but it’s only recently that AI has really taken on ‘a mind of its own’, so to speak. AI computers can now learn to play chess and other board games without any input whatsoever from humans.

Computers need to be able to read, write, navigate a changing world full of other agents with goals at odds with its own, to * learn * how to walk gracefully, to get better at any task *with practice*. These are all human traits that underlie our ability to learn to play chess and solve integrals. Starting with the final skill (logic based reasoning, math, games) is the wrong approach. AI should be based on educating a simple machine capable of learning anything. 

## We can use Python,  JAVA   and C++ programming languages for artificial intelligence research.

### *C++*

The very reason C++ is used in AI solutions is its speed; it is probably the fastest language out of all. Therefore, whenever speed is the prime concern of any AI developer, C++ is opted.

### *JAVA*

Java is in the top five because of its familiarity and easy to use features. This OOP language allows easy coding of algorithms which covers the major part of AI.

### *Python*

One of the leading languages used for developing AI Projects is Python which is because of its simplicity and easy coding behavior and is especially used in health-related startups involving AI.

##  **Machine learning**


#### *Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.*

#### *Machine learning is a new programming paradigm, a new way of communicating your wishes to a computer.*
 Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. We might, for instance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions, or to behave intelligently. The learning that is being done is always based on some sort of observations or data, such as examples (the most common case in this course), direct experience, or instruction. So in general, machine learning is about learning to do better in the future based on what was experienced in the past. The emphasis of machine learning is on automatic methods. In other words, the goal is to devise learning algorithms that do the learning automatically without human intervention or assistance. The machine learning paradigm can be viewed as “programming by example.” Often we have a specific task in mind, such as spam filtering. But rather than program the computer to solve the task directly, in machine learning, we seek methods by which the computer will come up with its own program based on examples that we provide. Machine learning is a core subarea of artificial intelligence. It is very unlikely that we will be able to build any kind of intelligent system capable of any of the facilities that we associate with intelligence, such as language or vision, without using learning to get there. These tasks are otherwise simply too difficult to solve. Further, we would not consider a system to be truly intelligent if it were incapable of learning since learning is at the core of intelligence. Although a subarea of AI, machine learning also intersects broadly with other fields, especially statistics, but also mathematics, physics, theoretical computer science and more. 

## **Deep Learning**

#### *Deep Learning is a machine learning method. It allows us to train an AI to predict outputs, given a set of inputs. Both supervised and unsupervised learning can be used to train the AI.*

Another algorithmic approach from the early machine-learning crowd, Artificial Neural Networks, came and mostly went over the decades. Neural Networks are inspired by our understanding of the biology of our brains – all those interconnections between the neurons. But, unlike a biological brain where any neuron can connect to any other neuron within a certain physical distance, these artificial neural networks have discrete layers, connections, and directions of data propagation.

## **diffrence between AI ML DL**

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two very hot buzzwords right now, and often seem to be used interchangeably. They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that they are can sometimes lead to some confusion
They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that they are can sometimes lead to some confusion. So I thought it would be worth writing a piece to explain the difference.

Both terms crop up very frequently when the topic is Big Data, analytics, and the broader waves of technological change which are sweeping through our world.


Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart” and Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.

Artificial Intelligence is the general category, common to all three. In a diagram, Artificial Intelligence would be the bigger, encapsulating circle that contains Machine and Deep Learning. AI is basically any intelligence demonstrated by a machine that leads it to an optimal or suboptimal solution given a problem.

Deep learning is basically machine learning on a “deeper” level (pun unavoidable, sorry). It’s inspired by how the human brain works, but requires high-end machines with discrete add-in graphics cards capable of crunching numbers, and enormous amounts of “big” data. Small amounts of data actually yield lower performance.

Unlike standard machine learning algorithms that break problems down into parts and solves them individually, deep learning solves the problem from end to end. Better yet, the more data and time you feed a deep learning algorithm, the better it gets at solving a task.

In our examples for machine learning, we used images consisting of boys and girls. The program used algorithms to sort these images mostly based on spoon-fed data. But with deep learning, data isn’t provided for the program to use. Instead, it scans all pixels within an image to discover edges that can be used to distinguish between a boy and a girl. After that, it will put edges and shapes into a ranked order of possible importance to determine the two genders.

On an even more simplified level, machine learning will distinguish between a square and triangle based on information provided by humans: squares have four points, and triangles have three. With deep learning, the program doesn’t start out with pre-fed information. Instead, it uses an algorithm to determine how many lines the shapes have, if those lines are connected, and if they are perpendicular. Naturally, the algorithm would eventually figure out that an inserted circle does not fit in with its square and triangle sorting.

Again, this latter “deep thinking” process requires more hardware to process the big data generated by the algorithm. These machines tend to reside in large datacenters to create an artificial neural network to handle all the big data generated and supplied to artificial intelligent applications. Programs using deep learning algorithms also take longer to train because they’re learning on their own instead of relying on hand-fed shortcuts.

“Deep Learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assists seem possible, even likely. Driverless cars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon,” writes Nvidia’s Michael Copeland. “With Deep Learning’s help, A.I. may even get to that science fiction state we’ve so long imagined.”

so machine learning is simply a way of achieving AI and  Deep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning.
